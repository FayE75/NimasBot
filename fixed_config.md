# Fixed Configuration for BotLi Chess Bot

## Issue
Your `standard_human` configuration with `random_selection: true` should work for human games, but there might be some issues with how the book keys are being matched.

## Solution
Here's the corrected configuration that ensures the `standard_human` configuration will work correctly:

```yaml
opening_books:
  enabled: true
  priority: 400
  read_learn: false
  books:
    # Existing configurations for bots
    0.5+0:
      selection: best_move
      names:
        - win
    bullet_white:
      selection: best_move
      names:
        - Carlsen
    bullet_black:
      selection: best_move
      names:
        - Gukesh
    blitz:
      selection: best_move

      selection: best_move
      names:
        - Nepomniachtchi
    
    # Configuration for human games
    standard_human:
      selection: weighted_random
      random_selection: true
      names:
        - Kasparov
        - Carlsen
        - Caruana
        - Ding
        - Gukesh
        - Nakamura
        - Nepomniachtchi
    
    # Additional configurations for specific time controls against humans
    bullet_human:
      selection: weighted_random
      random_selection: true
      names:
        - Kasparov
        - Carlsen
        - Caruana
        - Ding
        - Gukesh
        - Nakamura
        - Nepomniachtchi
    
    blitz_human:
      selection: weighted_random
      random_selection: true
      names:
        - Kasparov
        - Carlsen
        - Caruana
        - Ding
        - Gukesh
        - Nakamura
        - Nepomniachtchi

books:
  win: "./engines/win.bin"
  Kasparov: "./engines/Kasparov.bin"
  Carlsen: "./engines/Carlsen.bin"
  Caruana: "./engines/Caruana.bin"
  Ding: "./engines/Ding.bin"
  Gukesh: "./engines/Gukesh.bin"
  Nakamura: "./engines/Nakamura.bin"
  Nepomniachtchi: "./engines/Nepomniachtchi.bin"
```

## Explanation

1. **standard_human**: This configuration will be used for standard time controls against human opponents
2. **bullet_human**: This configuration will be used for bullet time controls against human opponents
3. **blitz_human**: This configuration will be used for blitz time controls against human opponents

The `random_selection: true` flag ensures that for each human game, one book will be randomly selected from the list, which is exactly what you wanted.

## How to Apply

1. Replace the `opening_books` section in your `config.yml` with the one provided above
2. Make sure all the book files exist in the `./engines/` directory
3. Restart your bot to apply the changes

## Debugging Tips

If you're still having issues, you can add some debug output to the `_get_book_key()` method in `lichess_game.py` to see which book key is being selected:

```python
def _get_book_key(self) -> str | None:
    # Add this line for debugging
    print(f"Looking for book key with suffixes: {suffixes}")
    
    # ... rest of the method
    
    # Add this line to see which key was selected
    print(f"Selected book key: {key}")
    return key
```

This will help you verify that the correct book configuration is being used for human games.
